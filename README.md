# Data Analytics Process - Real-Life Application Case Study

# 📌 Project Overview

Data Analytics is an essential part of our daily decision-making, often used unconsciously. This project explores how the Data Analytics process aligns with real-life scenarios and decision-making frameworks.

# 📊 Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

# 📝 Description

We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even realizing it. Consider a simple example: going to the market to buy something. Each step in this process follows a structured analytical approach.

# 🔍 Data Analytics Process Breakdown

Plan

Before going to the market, we decide what items we need (e.g., shirt, jeans, footwear, etc.).

Prepare

We check our budget and plan how to finance the purchase.

Process

We refine our choices based on preferences (e.g., if buying footwear, deciding between slippers, shoes, or sandals).

Analyze

We consider fashion trends and compatibility with existing wardrobe items (e.g., ensuring a shirt matches available jeans).

Share

We communicate our requirements to the shopkeeper to get the best options.

Act

We finalize and make the purchase.

🎯 Your Task

Your task is to identify and document a real-life scenario where the Data Analytics process is applied. You can prepare a PPT/PDF explaining the scenario using the steps above (Plan, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act) and submit it as part of this project.
